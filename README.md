## INFREQUENT PATTERN MINING ON DATA STREAMS WITH SRP-TREE AND RP-TREE VARIANTS

### Algorithms developed and implemented by Brett Aseltine
#### The following algorithms have been implemented
* RPStreamLandmark
* RPStreamSlidingWindow
* RPStreamTimeFading
* SRPLandmark
* SRPSlidingWindow
* SRPTimeFading

#### Execution Details
* Relevant files can be found at RPM_Project/src/ca/pfv/spmf/_RarePatternMiningFiles
* To run, copy RPM_Project folder in an ide (eclipse recommended) and run algorithms from testing folder.
* 
* Frequent Itemset Mining Dataset Repository datasets retrieved from http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/

#### Theory
* The formal report can be found in report.pdf
